## What it is?

Functional programming is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

---

## Characteristics

- Uses pure functions, which allow referential transparecy
- Avoids shared state
- Works with immutable data
- Minimizes/isolates side-effects
- Support higher-order functions
- Support of abstractions, encapsulations, inheritance and polymorphism
- Don't support flow-controls (if-else, switch, loops), but rather uses

## How it  works?

## Languages

### Pure
* Agda, Elm, Haskell, Hope, Idris, PureScript, SequenceL, etc...

### Impure
* Python, Java (since 1.8), **Kotlin**, Ruby, **Scala**, Perl, F#, Rust, OCaml, PHP, Dart, C#, Lisp, etc...

---

## Benefits
  - Pure functions are easier to reason about. 
  - Better suited for concurrency and parallel programming.
  - Usually strong-typed, helps reducing bugs and improves testing.
  - Programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend.
  - Programs are stateless

---

## Drawbacks
  - Using only immutable values and recursion can potentially lead to performance problems, including RAM use and speed.
  - Requires different thinking from imperative programming.
  - Writing pure functions is easy, but combining them into a complete application is where things get hard.
  - The advanced math terminology (monad, monoid, functor, etc.) makes FP intimidating.

## Kotlin - What is Kotlin
Kotlin is an open-source statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript and Native.

It’s developed by JetBrains. The project started in 2010 and was open source from very early on.

The first official 1.0 release was in February 2016.

## Is Kotlin an object-oriented language or a functional one?

Kotlin has both object-oriented and functional constructs.
You can use it in both OO and FP styles, or mix elements of the two. With first-class support for features such as higher-order functions, function types and lambdas, Kotlin is a great choice if you’re doing or exploring functional programming.
