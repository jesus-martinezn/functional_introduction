## What it is?

Functional programming is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

## Characteristics

- Uses pure functions,  which allow referential transparecy
- Avoids shared state
- Works with immutable data
- Minimizes/isolates side-effects
- Support higher-order functions
- Support of abstractions, encapsulations, inheritance and polymorphism
- Don't support flow-controls (if-else, switch, loops), but rather uses
