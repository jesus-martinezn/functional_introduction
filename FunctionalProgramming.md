## What it is?

Functional programming is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

---

## Characteristics

- Uses pure functions, which allow referential transparecy
- Avoids shared state
- Works with immutable data
- Minimizes/isolates side-effects
- Support higher-order functions
- Support of abstractions, encapsulations, inheritance and polymorphism
- Don't support flow-controls (if-else, switch, loops), but rather uses

## Languages

### Pure
* Agda, Elm, Haskell, Hope, Idris, PureScript, SequenceL, etc...

### Impure
* Python, Java (since 1.8), **Kotlin**, Ruby, **Scala**, Perl, F#, Rust, OCaml, PHP, Dart, C#, Lisp, etc...

---

## Benefits
  - Pure functions are easier to reason about. 
  - Better suited for concurrency and parallel programming.
  - Usually strong-typed, helps reducing bugs and improves testing.
  - Programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend.
  - Programs are stateless
---

## Drawbacks
  - Using only immutable values and recursion can potentially lead to performance problems, including RAM use and speed.
  - Requires different thinking from imperative programming.
  - Writing pure functions is easy, but combining them into a complete application is where things get hard.
  - The advanced math terminology (monad, monoid, functor, etc.) makes FP intimidating.
